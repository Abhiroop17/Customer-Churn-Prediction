# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn, which is when a customer stops using a company's product or service. Predicting churn is crucial for businesses, especially in subscription-based industries like telecom, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project uses a dataset with customer attributes and leverages machine learning to identify patterns that could indicate a higher likelihood of a customer leaving the service.

Project Workflow and How It Works
Data Collection: We start with a dataset that includes details about customers, such as demographic information, account information, and usage patterns. In this case, we use a sample telecom customer churn dataset, which contains features like contract type, tenure, payment methods, and monthly charges.

Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing is essential to clean and prepare data for modeling:

Drop Irrelevant Columns: We drop columns that are unique to each user, like customerID, as they donâ€™t contribute to predicting churn.

Handle Missing Values: Some columns may have missing values, such as TotalCharges, which can be imputed with a reasonable statistic, like the column mean.
Encode Categorical Features: Machine learning algorithms require numerical input, so categorical features are converted to numerical values using label encoding or one-hot encoding. For example, a gender column with values "Male" and "Female" would be converted to 0 and 1.

Feature Scaling: Standardize numerical features to bring them to a similar scale, improving model performance.
Data Splitting: We split the dataset into training and testing sets, allowing us to train the model on one portion of the data and test its predictive power on unseen data.

Model Selection: We choose a machine learning model to predict churn. In this case, we use a RandomForestClassifier, an ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction. The model is particularly effective for structured data like customer churn datasets.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, we fine-tune the hyperparameters of the RandomForestClassifier. This involves testing various combinations of model parameters like:

n_estimators: The number of trees in the forest.

max_depth: Maximum depth of each tree, which helps control overfitting.

min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf: Parameters to define how trees split, which also helps in regularization.

Hyperparameter tuning helps us find the best-performing configuration for the model, improving accuracy and reliability.

Model Training: With the optimized hyperparameters, we train the RandomForestClassifier on the training set. The model learns from historical data, identifying patterns associated with churned and retained customers.

Model Evaluation: We evaluate the model's performance on the test set using metrics such as:

Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correct predictions.

Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for churn and non-churn classes.

Confusion Matrix: Shows the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, helping us understand where the model performs well or needs improvement.

Feature Importance Analysis: After training, we analyze feature importance to identify which attributes contribute most to churn. For instance, features like Contract Type, Tenure, or Monthly Charges might have a strong influence on churn, providing actionable insights for the business to improve customer retention strategies.
